# About

PINES was created out of a need to scale up the annotation of large patient cohort datasets for clinical events. The first use case was cancer-associated venous thromboembolism, but from the start we aimed to develop a generic tool which could be used to detect a broad range of events. This software is under development at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center \(MSKCC\)](https://www.mskcc.org).

The package authors include:

- [Simon Mantha, MD, MPH](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/doctors/simon-mantha): project lead, clinical hematologist by training
