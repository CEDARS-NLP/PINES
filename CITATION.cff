  PINES (Progressive Inference Networked Episodic Service)
  is a natural language processing (NLP) package aimed at
  detecting clinical events in the electronic health record
  (EHR). This software suite incorporates specialized
  functions and a dedicated application programming
  interface (API) designed to facilitate its use as a
  service integrated with a CEDARS instance, even though it
  can be used as a standalone tool as well. PINES exists as
  an open-source Python package under GPL-3 license. The
  latest package and prior versions can be cloned from
  GitHub. Full documentation is available here. Please see
  the Terms of Use before using this software. PINES is
  provided as-is with no guarantee whatsoever and users
  agree to be held responsible for compliance with their
  local government/institutional regulations.
