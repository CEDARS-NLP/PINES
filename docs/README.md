# Overview

## Background

PINES \(Progressive Inference Networked Episodic Service\) is a natural language processing \(NLP\) package aimed at detecting clinical events in the electronic health record \(EHR\). This software suite incorporates specialized functions and a dedicated application programming interface \(API\) designed to facilitate its use as a service integrated with a [CEDARS](https://www.cedars.io) instance, even though it can be used as a standalone tool as well. PINES exists as an open-source Python package under [GPL-3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). The latest package and prior versions can be cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/CEDARS-NLP/PINES). Full documentation is available [here](https://pines.ai).
