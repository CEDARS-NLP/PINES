General Requirements Local installation Python 3.9 or later poetry Docker installation Docker Installation Local To install the package locally, run the following commands: git clone https://github.com/CEDARS-NLP/PINES.git cd PINES poetry install # this will install all required packages poetry run python pines.py # this will run the package Docker git clone https://github.com/CEDARS-NLP/PINES.git docker build -t pines-api . docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:8036:8036 pines-api Basic Concepts Input: Clinical Note Output: Label, Score We fine tuned the clinical-longformer 1 model on our dataset. The clinical-longformer, starting with Longformer checkpoint, was further pre-trained on MIMIC-III dataset. After finetuning, the model is then used to predict the presence of a label in a new clinical note. The model outputs a score which is a measure of the confidence of the model in the prediction. Note: The trained models are not open-source and are not included in the repository. Please email the authors for access to the trained models.
